![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
The task was to build a text editor that runs in the browser, and that meets the PWA criteria. This text editor will feature a number of data persistence techniques and will also function offline..

For this application, I used IndexedDB to store data. I also installed idb to help with retrieving and storing data in IndexedDB.
